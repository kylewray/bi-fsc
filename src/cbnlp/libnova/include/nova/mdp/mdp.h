/**
 *  A structure for an MDP object within nova.
 *  @param  n               The number of states.
 *  @param  ns              The maximum number of successor states.
 *  @param  m               The number of actions.
 *  @param  gamma           The discount factor in [0.0, 1.0).
 *  @param  horizon         The number of iterations to execute (i.e., horizon).
 *  @param  epsilon         The convergence criterion for SSP algorithms like LAO*.
 *  @param  s0              The optional goal state for an SSP.
 *  @param  ng              The optional number of goals.
 *  @param  goals           The optional k-array of goal state indexes.
 *  @param  S               A mapping of state-action-successor triples (n-m-ns array) to a
 *                          state index. Reading the array 0 to ns-1, a value of -1 means
 *                          there are no more successors (terminating any loops).
 *  @param  T               A mapping of state-action-successor triples (n-m-ns array) to a
 *                          transition probability.
 *  @param  R               A mapping of state-action pairs (n-m array) to a reward.
 *  @param  d_goals         Device-side pointer of goals.
 *  @param  d_S             Device-side pointer of S.
 *  @param  d_T             Device-side pointer of T.
 *  @param  d_R             Device-side pointer of R.
