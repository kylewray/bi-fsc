/**
 *  A structure for a POMDP object within nova.
 *  @param  n               The number of states.
 *  @param  ns              The maximum number of successor states possible.
 *  @param  m               The number of actions, in total, that are possible.
 *  @param  z               The number of observations.
 *  @param  r               The number of belief points.
 *  @param  rz              The maximum number of non-zero belief states.
 *  @param  gamma           The discount factor in [0.0, 1.0).
 *  @param  horizon         The number of iterations to execute (i.e., horizon).
 *  @param  S               A mapping of state-action-successor triples (n-m-ns array) to a state
 *                          index. Reading the array 0 to ns-1, a value of -1 means there are
 *                          no more successors (terminating any loops).
 *  @param  T               A mapping of state-action-successor triples (n-m-ns array) to a
 *                          transition probability.
 *  @param  O               A mapping of action-state-observations triples (m-n-z array) to a
 *                          transition probability.
 *  @param  R               A mapping of state-action triples (n-m array) to a reward.
 *  @param  Z               A mapping of belief-non-zero-state pairs (r-rz array) to a state index.
 *                          Reading the array 0 to rz-1, a value of -1 means there are no more
 *                          states with a non-zero belief value (terminating any loops).
 *  @param  B               A mapping of belief-non-zero-state pairs (r-rz array) consisting of r
 *                          sets of rz-vector belief distributions.
 *  @param  d_S             Device-side pointer of S. GPU version only.
 *  @param  d_T             Device-side pointer of T. GPU version only.
 *  @param  d_O             Device-side pointer of O. GPU version only.
